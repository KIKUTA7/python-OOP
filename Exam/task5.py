""" Task 5 [5 points]"""

"""
Write 'sortTuple' function, that takes a tuple as an argument,
sorts it's elements in decreasing order and returns the resulting
tuple.

Sorting sould be done using merge sort algorithm (described bellow).
Solution that uses other algorithm or built in functions (like sort
and sorted) will not be accepted.

Merge Sort algorithm is using 'Divide and Conquer' method to sort
given sequence. Sequence with 1 or 0 elements is considered already
sorted. While sequence with 2 or more elements is sorted with the 
following steps:
    1. Divide sequence in 2 parts - Each partition should contaion
       roughly half elements of the initial sequence.
    2. Sort each partition independently using Merge Sort.
    3. Assume that both of the partitions are already sorted and 
       merge them togather. After merging resulting sequence should
       also be sorted.
    4. Return resulting sequence
